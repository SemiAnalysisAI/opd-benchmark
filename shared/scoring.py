"""reasoning_gym exact-match scoring for thinking-mode responses.

The rule used by the teacher GRPO runs: take the text after the last `</think>`
(a response cut off mid-thought scores 0), read its `<answer>`, and score 1 when
reasoning_gym's `score_answer` returns 1. In OPD this score is diagnostic only;
the training signal is the teachers' token log probabilities.

Requires `reasoning-gym==0.1.25`. Campaigns may provide it as a directory in
`$CAMPAIGN_PYDEPS`, which is searched after the runtime's own packages.
